# aplic-example
This baremetal example is meant to be used as a software example within
validation-software and demonstrates how to set up and trigger APLIC interrupts.
It uses the BEU to demonstrate global interrupt handling.
Software and timer interrupts are also demonstrated.
Lastly, an APLIC interrupt is triggered using the SETIPNUM method.
